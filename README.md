# Self Driving Car (JS)

**This is live on <https://harshit-soni78.github.io/Self-Driving-Car-Simulator/>**

## Instructions

- To train the model, we first need to capture the suitable parameters.
- To capture these, we need to constantly refresh the page and click on the save button.
- The save button is for saving parameters of the first car in front.
- The reset button is for resetting the entire set of parameters and starting from the beginning.
- After sufficient iterations, we can obtain those parameters by inspecting the webpage and accessing the console.
- If you want to edit the number of sensors, length of sensor, number of cars, etc. we can do this in code.
- Just pull the repo and run on any browswe or on live server.
